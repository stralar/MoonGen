.SH NAME
rude \- real-time UDP data emitter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rude
.B -s 
.I file 
.B [ -h ] [ -v ]
.B [ -P
.I 0-90 
.B ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.IB Rude 
sends UDP data into network as configured in the script 
.IB file.
Currently 
.IB CONSTANT 
bitrate and 
.IB TRACE 
type of flows are supported. The 
.IB CONSTANT 
bitrate is specified by configuring the packet size 
(UDP data size in bytes) and rate (packets per second). The 
.IB TRACE 
type of flow configuration is given as a separate text file, which can be 
generated from e.g. a 
.B tcpdump(8) 
trace. It consists of two columns where the first column describes the packet 
size and the second column time to wait before the next transmission.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-s
The script 
.IB file 
describing the flows to be sent by the rude program. 
See ../rude/DOC/example.cfg, for an example. 
.IP \fB\-h 
Print a short help.
.IP \fB\-v
Print the version information. 
.IP \fB\-P
Set the process in real-time round-robin scheduling with the given 
.IB priority\fP. 
Needs root permission. Use with care.


.SH CONFIGURATION FILE

Every configuration file should contain at least three (3) commands:
the 
.IB START
, one flow 
.IB ON 
and one flow 
.IB OFF 
command. If that requirement is not met or the parser can not recognize all 
the given commands in the file, the configuration file will be considered 
corrupted and the program will exit without any further action.

Lines starting with '#' or empty lines are treated as comments (i.e. are
not processed). Configuration file can hold any number of comment lines
anywhere in the file.

The 
.IB START 
command must be the 1st command in the configuration file.
It may be preceded with comment lines, but nothing else. If your config
file has more than one (1) 
.IB START 
command, the parsing will fail and the
program will exit with error.

Configuration file should hold at least two commands for each flow:
the 
.IB ON 
and 
.IB OFF 
commands. Between the 
.IB ON 
and 
.IB OFF 
commands can be random/any number of 
.IB MODIFY 
commands, which alter the flow behaviour.
Note that 
.IB MODIFY 
commands are not available for every flow type.

Commands for each flow must be ordered according to the time - i.e.
the 
.IB ON 
command must be the 1st command for the specific flow and the
.IB MODIFY 
commands must be ordered by the time-field. The 
.IB OFF 
command must be the last command for the flow. The commands for each flow can
be "mixed" or each flow can have their configuration on different segment
in the file. See ../rude/DOC/README.rude for detailed information
on the configuration file.

.SH TODO
Support more flow types.
