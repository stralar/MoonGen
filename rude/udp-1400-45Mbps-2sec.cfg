## This is the example configuration script file for rude.
##
## Empty lines or lines beginning with '#' character are skipped...
##
## The 1ST command line must be the START command, which sets the
## absolute START time for the rude program. You can use "shortcut"
## NOW if no delay is required. Here are two examples.
## START NOW
## START 17:20:00
##
START NOW

## FLOW 1: (flow ID = 30)
##
## Starts 1 second after the START time with following parameters:
##   200 packets/second with 250 bytes/packet = 50kbytes/sec (1kbyte=1000bytes)
##
## 2 seconds from that the flow is modified to following parameters:
##   400 packets/second with 500 bytes/packet = 200kbytes/sec
##
## 1 second from that the flow is modified to following parameters:
##   1000 packets/second with 1000 bytes/packet = 1000kbytes/sec
##
## 1 second from that the flow is turned off...
##
## 1Mbps = 1000000 bits per second
## 1Mbps / 8 = 125kbytes/sec
## 125kbytes/sec / 1400 bytes/packet = 91,4286
## So only need your X Mbps * 91,4286 = (searched packets/second)
